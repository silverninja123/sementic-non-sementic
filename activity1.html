                    <h2>Facts about dogs</h2>
                    <p>Dogs are loyal and intelligent animals that have been companions to humans for thousands of years. They belong to the species Canis lupus familiaris, a domesticated subspecies of the gray wolf. Known for their keen senses, especially their sense of smell, dogs are used in various roles such as police work, search and rescue, and even detecting medical conditions like cancer or low blood sugar. There are over 340 recognized dog breeds worldwide, ranging from tiny Chihuahuas to massive Great Danes, each bred for specific traits like herding, guarding, or companionship. Dogs communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent, and they are known for their ability to form strong emotional bonds with humans. Their social nature and responsiveness to training make them one of the most popular pets globally.</p>

                <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.</p>
